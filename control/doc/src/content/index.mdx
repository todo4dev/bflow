## Key Capabilities

Bflow offers a robust multi-tenant architecture for modern infrastructure management:

- **Cluster Management**: Allows each client to manage their own Kubernetes cluster with full autonomy.
- **Agent-based Deployment**: The entire application is deployed via an agent installed directly in the client's cluster, facilitating communication and management.
- **Isolation and Security**: Ensure complete data and resource segregation between different environments and clients on a single platform.
